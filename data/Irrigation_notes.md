# Irrigation Management

- Irrigate when matic potential reaches 20 kPa (FC at 33 kPa)
- Yild loss of 10-15% for irrigation scheduling at 30-35 kPa
- Observed no of irrigations should be around 20 
- Recommended 10-12 irrigations at 5-7 day spacing -> yield loss!
- First irrgation 100-120 mm
- Irrigation cutt-off 10-14 days before harvest
- Wheat irrgation no more than 5 times
